This repo contains a simple project covering the basics of React such as:

- Components
- CSS modules
- useState()
- Forms
- Children
- useEffect()
- HTTP requests
- Routing

For starting the frontend you need to run the following commands inside the _frontend_ folder:

```

The React app communicates with a Node.js BE located in the backend folder.

To start the backend run the following commands inside the _backend_ folder:
